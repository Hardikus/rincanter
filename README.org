Welcome to Rincanter!

* About
  Rincanter is a clojure/incanter wrapper around the rosuda JRIEngine
  Java/R bridge. The hope is to allow easy access to an embedded R
  engine from incanter. It also offers translation between
  clojure/incanter datatypes and R datatypes such as R dataframe to
  incanter dataset.
* Install
  As rincanter sits on top the org.rosuda JRI and JRIEngine packages,
  you will need install these to use rincanter. This can be a bit
  tricky, as the JRI component needs to compile some native JNI libs
  and install them on the java.library.path in order to run.
** Download and Install the rosuda JRI and REngine components

#+begin_example 
   svn co svn://svn.rforge.net/org/trunk/rosuda/REngine
   svn://svn.rforge.net/org/trunk/rosuda/JRI
   cd JRI
   configure && make
#+end_example

You will now have a jri library file in this directory. Depending on
your platform it will have a name like: libjri.so (linux)
libjri.jnilib (Mac OS X) jri.dll (Windows)

#+begin_example 
  cd ../REngine
  configure && make
#+end_example

You will now have an REngine.jar file in this directory.

#+begin_example 
  cd JRI # this is a child dir of REngine, different from the JRI dir above
  configure && make
#+end_example

You will now have an JRIEngine.jar file in this directory.

** Install incanter from git
I am using features in incanter that are in git but not up on clojars
yet. You will need to pull incanter from github and from the incanter
directory run:

#+begin_example 
  lein install
#+end_example


Now you are ready to download rincanter and run it:

#+begin_example 
  lein test
#+end_example

To start a swank-repl: 

#+begin_example 
  lein repl
#+end_example
